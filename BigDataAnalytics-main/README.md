## ⚙️ 2. Inferred Analysis Workflow

The repository is organized into a sequence of numbered notebooks, each representing a key stage of a big data processing pipeline.  
This structured flow suggests an educational or practical learning approach to PySpark-based analytics.

### 🪜 Step-by-Step Workflow

#### 🔹 Step 1: Data Transformation Using PySpark RDD
The workflow begins with **data transformation** using PySpark’s **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)** — the foundational data structure in PySpark.  
Here, raw data is cleaned, structured, and prepared for distributed processing.

#### 🔹 Step 2: Collect() Operation with RDD
Next, the **`collect()`** operation is employed to retrieve data from distributed RDD partitions to the driver node.  
This allows viewing and verifying transformation outputs for smaller data subsets.

#### 🔹 Step 3: Sample() and TakeSample() Methods
These operations are used to **extract random samples** from the dataset.  
Sampling helps in rapid testing, preliminary exploration, and reducing large datasets for quick insights.

#### 🔹 Step 4: Exploring CSV Structure and Contents
Focus then shifts to understanding the structure of CSV files.  
Key operations include:
- Inferring schema  
- Checking column data types  
- Previewing initial rows  
- Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)

#### 🔹 Step 5: Viewing and Selecting Specific Columns
Data selection techniques are used to isolate relevant features from the dataset.  
This ensures that further analytical operations focus only on meaningful attributes.

#### 🔹 Step 6: Analytical Operations on CSV Data
Core **data analysis operations** are performed using PySpark DataFrame APIs:
- Aggregations (`groupBy`, `agg`)  
- Filtering and sorting (`filter`, `orderBy`)  
- Statistical calculations (mean, min, max)  
- Derived column creation (`withColumn`)

#### 🔹 Step 7: IMDb Top-Rated Movies Analysis (Mini Project)
The workflow concludes with a **mini-project** analyzing IMDb movie ratings.  
It applies all previously learned PySpark techniques to extract insights such as:
- Top-rated movies and directors  
- Rating distributions  
- Comparison between IMDb and Meta Scores
